### Prompts:

Create a simple, responsive website that calculates tree height using trigonometry. The user will enter:

1. Distance from the tree (in meters).
2. Either the angle of elevation (in degrees) or the line-of-sight distance (hypotenuse in meters).

The site should:

- Use the formula: height = base_distance * tan(angle) if the angle is provided.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem if the hypotenuse is provided: height = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - base_distance^2).
- Have an intuitive UI with labeled input fields, a calculate button, and a display area for results.
- Use JavaScript for calculations and display dynamic error messages for invalid inputs.
- Style the page with a clean, minimal design using CSS.
- Make it mobile-friendly and ensure a smooth user experience.
- Support both metric and imperial measures.
- Feature a forest green color scheme.
- Add Detailed Instructions
- Take the logo from my assets folder and put it at the top.
